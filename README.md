If the Don's twitter post rate isn't satiating your hunger for confusion and existential dread, boy do we have a treat for you.

Randomly generate presidential quality tweets whenever, wherever with the click of a button!

Implemented through a simple markov chain based on word trigrams, every B I G T R U M P tweet I could find was scraped and used as a basis to
generate fake ones.

The quality of the results vary right now as I'm still tweaking the methods of word generation, but since the B I G D O N seems
willing to tweet literally anything I don't think it matters too much.

Some gems include :

There are of course lots of flops. Sometimes the generation gets convoluted and rambles on for too long, or gets cut short due to poor
sentence structure / typos.

Honestly? I could still see it

Looking forward, I plan on implementing better pre-processing and experimentation with different generative models. But for now, hope this 
brought something close to a smile to your face.
